# ReadingAndWritingFromFiles
I simply read from a file that has integers that mean different values and each column has a different meaning. 
Each column has a different meaning to compare each rating. Each integer in a row represnts a customer, service method, product rate, price ratings, and service ratings.
I simply read from the correct row to give ensure the correct rows are read into for each function.
